Contractors
============
1. Once contractor scans QRcode, it shows the list of maintenance report of that room (may be more than one report of same room)
2. Only after QRcode scan, he/she can swipe to left and click checked to verify the room is checked (This check button is not shown unless QRcode is scanned)
3. However, contractor can swipe and click uncheck button even QRcode is not scanned (This is to undo if they checked by mistake).
